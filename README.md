### What does it do?
The Anti-Doomscroller extension allows you to set a time limit on how long you want to be on social media. Then, it automatically shows you videos within your time limit. For the people who watch halfway through, you can click on multiple videos and watch as many videos as you want within the limit. However, the further along in your break, the fewer videos become available. Don't worry; you can always finish a video that you are currently watching.

### This sounds so cool how do I download it??
NOTE: This project is optimized for Firefox.  It may not work as intended on chromium-based browsers.

After downloaded the zip and unzipping the folder follow these steps to activate the extenstion.
1. In the search bar for Firefox, search for (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
2. Next click on the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button
3. Navigate to the extension folder and select `manifest.json` (for chrome just select the folder)

For more information on how to activate the extenstion here is a link to a freecodecamp article. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/write-your-own-browser-extensions/
